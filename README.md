# reddit-lexical-variation
An exploration into various lexical variations across different subreddits.

By comparing the relative frequencies of words in complementary distribution (i.e. Contractions vs Non-Contracted Counterpart), we find that subreddits that are more similiar in content, are also more likely to speak the same. We learned a lot of cool stuff!

Some charts from our paper:
